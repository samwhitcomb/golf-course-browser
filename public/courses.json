      "Jack Neville and Douglas Grant's 1919 design occupies the most stunning oceanfront property in golf on California's Monterey Peninsula. The course's genius is its routing, which brings players to the cliffs of Carmel Bay for dramatic sequences at holes 4-10 and the iconic finish from the par-3 17th over the ocean to the par-5 18th along the shore. The small, sloping poa annua greens are fiercely defended by coastal winds and deep bunkers.",
      "The experience is a blend of breathtaking beauty and demanding championship golf, where club selection changes by the minute with the Pacific breeze. It has hosted six U.S. Opens, with winners like Jack Nicklaus, Tom Watson, and Tiger Woods claiming historic victories. Golfers remember the visceral feeling of hitting shots where the land ends, making it a public-access pilgrimage that lives up to its monumental reputation."

The routing offers panoramic views of Peconic Bay and seamlessly blends the templates into the natural, rolling Long Island terrain.",

Built on a reclaimed sand quarry, the course is a wild, visual rollercoaster with massive elevation changes, blind shots, huge waste areas, and dramatically contoured fairways and greens. The par-4 13th, requiring a tee shot over a vast sandy waste to a hidden fairway, exemplifies its thrilling, risk-reward philosophy.",

It is not a traditional strategic test but an exhilarating sensory experience. Golfers either love or hate its in-your-face style, but no one forgets it. They remember it for its bold, theatrical design, its fun and playability for those who follow the cues, and its status as one of the most original courses built in the last 50 years."

The course is known for its exceptional conditioning, strategic bunkering, and the famous par-3 16th hole, where the tee shot carries over a deep, wooded ravine to a well-bunkered green—a dramatic and beautiful one-shotter.",

It has hosted multiple USGA national championships. Golfers remember it for its timeless Trent Jones design, its immaculate presentation, and the specific, thrilling challenge of the signature 16th hole."
