The overall feel is more rugged and intimate, with greens that are often more severely contoured.

**Paragraph 2:** The experience highlights walking and strategy, with caddies highly recommended to navigate the blind shots and complex greens. It is often praised for its fun and playability, with more risk-reward opportunities than the Red.
